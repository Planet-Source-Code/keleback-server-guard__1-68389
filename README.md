### Description

Hi all. This is a very simple but effective application to keep servers up. This is coded for server systems running on ordinary PCs. Checks selected services in a schedule and restarts them if necessary. And also restarts the server in a given time. I used someone elses code pieces here from psc but cant remember authors names. I wrote this code 3 yrs before. So please forgive me.. And also wanna thank to everybody who share codes especially owner of the class that I used.. Enjoy... (By the way its in Turkish so here is the pocket dictionary: &#199;izelge--&gt;Schedule, &#221;zlenecek Hizmetler--&gt;Services to watch, Ekle--&gt;Add, &#199;&#253;kar--&gt;Remove, Yeniden Ba&#254;lat--&gt;Restart, Windows ba&#254;lad&#253;&#240;&#253;nda ba&#254;la--&gt;Start when Windows starts, Tamam--&gt;OK)
